### Wk2 [Phi Phenomenon](phi.ino)

When the switch is pressed, a current flows to digital pin D1. This triggers a sequence of events controlled by a C++ program. The program iterates through pins D2 to D7, setting each pin to HIGH, then LOW, with a brief delay between each state change. This creates a sequential lighting effect, known as the phi phenomenon, where the bulbs appear to light up one after another.

- **Switch** connected to 3V3 pin and D1 pin,  10k ohm to  - rail/GND
- **LEDs** conneted to D2-D7 with 220 Î© registors to - to GND

### Wk3 [Smart Chair Part1](smart_chair_part1.ino)
A capacitive touch sensor is used to detect chair occupancy. A photoresistor measures ambient light levels to determine day or night. The system utilizes an RGB LED module to visually indicate the chair's status and the time of day.
**Photoregistor** gives **analog** input whereas **Touch sensor** signal has a built in ADC so it sends binary of HIGH 1 or LOW 0

- **RGB LED Module** connects to: R -> D2, G -> D3, B -> D4 , GND -> - rail 
- **Capacitive Touch sensor** SIG -> D5 (General Input Output pin) 
- **Photoregistor** SIG -> A0 (Analog to Digital Converter pin)
